This folder must contain pseudo observations from RCMs (optional, only needed for pseudoreality experiments).

Each GCM/RCM combination must be in a separate folder named hres_$GCM_$RCM.

Example:
hres_CNRM-CERFACS-CNRM-CM5_CNRM-ALADIN63

And that folder must contain the same files as in hres folder (hres_metadata.txt, tmax.txt, tmin.txt, pcp.txt)
